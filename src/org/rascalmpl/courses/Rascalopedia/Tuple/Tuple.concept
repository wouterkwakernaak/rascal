Description:

A tuple is an ordered fixed length sequence of values of possibly different type.

In Rascal a tuple is written as `<` $V_1$, ..., $V_n$ `>` and a tuple type has the form `type[$T_1$, ..., $T_n$]`,
$T_i$ represents the type of element $i$. Tuple have two major applications:
* As tuples in a [Relation].
* For ad-hoc packaging of values, for instance, to return multiple-values from a function.


See [Rascal:Values/Tuple] for the operations on tuples.
