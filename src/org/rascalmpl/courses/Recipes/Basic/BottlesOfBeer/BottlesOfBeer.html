<span class="sectionHead">Description</span>  Programs that generate the lyrics for the song <i>99 Bottles of Beer</i> are a popular way to compare programming languages.
 At <a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/">99-bottles-of-beer.net<img src="/images/www-icon.png" with="20" height="20"></a> you can find versions in nearly 1500 different languages
 and the lyrics can be found <a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html">here<img src="/images/www-icon.png" with="20" height="20"></a>.

</div>

  	                       
<div id="Examples">
<span class="sectionHead">Examples</span>  Here is our version:
 <pre class="listing">module demo::basic::Bottles

import IO;

str bottles(0)     = "no more bottles"; <img src="/images/1.png">
str bottles(1)     = "1 bottle";
default str bottles(int n) = "&lt;n> bottles"; <img src="/images/2.png">

public void sing(){ <img src="/images/3.png">
  for(n &lt;- [99 .. 0]){
       println("&lt;bottles(n)> of beer on the wall, &lt;bottles(n)> of beer.");
       println("Take one down, pass it around, &lt;bottles(n-1)> of beer on the wall.\n");
  }  
  println("No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.");
  println("Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.");
}
</pre> We use an auxiliary function <code>bottles</code> (<img src="/images/1.png">) that returns the word "bottle" adjusted for the actual number of bottles that is available.
 Observe how we use the patterns <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>int n</code> in the definition of three variants of this function.
 <br/>
<br/>

 <i>Pattern-directed invocation</i> (see <a href="/Rascal/Declarations/Function/Function.html">Rascal:Function</a>) will determine at the call site which function will be called. The
 general case (<img src="/images/2.png">) is labeled with <code>default</code> to indicate that if the case for 0 and 1 do not match, this alternative should handle the other cases. 
 <br/>
<br/>

 The main function is <code>sing</code> (<img src="/images/3.png">) that iterates over the numbers 99 downto 1 (as described by the range <code>[99 .. 1]</code>)
 and prints appriopriate lyrics. Observe how the value  of the <code>bottles</code> function is interpolated several times in the string.
 <br/>
<br/>

 Here is the result:
